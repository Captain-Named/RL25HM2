# Cross-Shaped TicTacToe PPO Training System

A deep reinforcement learning implementation using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) to train an agent for a cross-shaped TicTacToe variant.

## Project Structure

```python
training_10/
│   README.md
│   Config.py          # Configuration parameters
│   Networks.py        # Neural network architectures 
│   Utils.py          # Utility functions
│   train_PPO.py      # Main training script
│   play_the_game.py  # Game evaluation & testing
```

## Key Components

### 1. Configuration (Config.py)
- Game parameters (board size, action space)
- Network architecture settings
- Training hyperparameters (learning rate, GAE, etc.)
- Model saving/loading paths

### 2. Neural Networks (Networks.py)
- Policy Network: Action probability distribution
- Value Network: State value estimation
- Residual block architecture for deep feature extraction

### 3. Training System (train_PPO.py)
- PPO implementation with TorchRL
- Data collection & replay buffer management
- Training loop with multiple epochs
- Model checkpointing & metrics logging

### 4. Game Environment
- Cross-shaped 12x12 board with 80 valid positions
- Win conditions: 4-in-line horizontal/vertical, 5-in-line diagonal
- Success rate mechanics for move execution

### 5. Utilities (Utils.py)
- Board state calculations
- Training metrics visualization
- Debug & monitoring tools
- TensorDict data structure helpers

## Usage

1. Train the model:
```bash
python train_PPO.py
```

2. Play against trained agent:
```bash
python play_the_game.py
```

## Dependencies

- PyTorch
- TorchRL
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm

## Configuration Parameters

Key parameters in 

Config.py

:
```python
success_rate = 1.0    # Move execution success rate
board_size = 12       # Board dimensions
num_actions = 80      # Valid action positions
learning_rate = 3e-4  # Training learning rate
```

## Model Training

The system:
1. Collects experience batches
2. Calculates advantages using GAE
3. Updates policy & value networks using PPO
4. Tracks metrics & saves checkpoints

## Notes

- Checkpoints saved in 

training_model


- Training curves plotted automatically
- Best model retained based on rewards
```

Testing

run tests using 
```bash
python -m pytest PPO_test/test_train_ppo.py -v
```
